### Comprehensive Setup
P4G CEP contains **every tool** needed to set up and play P4G with mods, along with step-by-step instructions for setup and additional tips and tricks.

### Faithful Enhancements
P4G CEP includes **over 40 enhancement mods** that improve on the base game in a variety of ways. Whether it's improved textures, faster fast travel, or just making Dojima's talksprite blink, these mods make for a better first or five hundredth playthrough of P4G.

There are also a few **cheat sheet mods**, intended to let players experience everything on repeat playthroughs without having to look up a guide. *We don't recommend using these your first time playing!*

### Customization
P4G CEP includes the **Aemulus Package Manager** program to make customization easy. All of the mods in P4G CEP can be individually enabled or disabled with Aemulus, and it's easy for users to **add additional mods** to their loadout without having to manually merge files.

### Compatibility
P4G CEP is **fully compatible with unmodded P4G save data** and does not affect story progression or Steam achievement unlocks. You do not need to start a new game before using P4G CEP.

### Ease of Access
P4G CEP is intended to be accessible for beginners to modding. It contains detailed instructions and illustrations, and the team runs an active **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/aZkkqnw)** where you can get update notifications and request support. Everything is neatly organized to encourage good practice when modding games.
