# Upgrade P4G CEP

### An Internet connection is required.

Please note that after upgrading, the package grid layout will be reset to default. 

Any custom packages you have installed will be disabled and moved to the bottom of the grid, but not deleted.

## Upgrading from v6.x

If you're upgrading from v6.0, you'll have the ability to get **automatic upgrades** in the future!

- If you have *Enable Mod Updates* and *Update All on Refresh* enabled in Aemulus, follow the **Automatic Upgrade** instructions.
- Otherwise, follow the **Manual Upgrade** Instructions.

### Automatic Upgrade

- Launch Aemulus. If you get a prompt to upgrade the program, click **Yes** and wait for Aemulus to update.
- After Aemulus restarts, it will automatically prompt you to download the latest version of P4G CEP. Select **Yes**.

> Make sure you are using **Aemulus 5.1.5+** before upgrading! Any older version will NOT install the upgrade properly!

## Upgrading from Older Versions
P4G CEP requires a fresh start for all users upgrading from any version older than **6.0**.

Please follow the directions in [Getting Started](https://github.com/Pixelguin/P4G-CEP-docs/blob/master/docs/02_getting_started.md) (you can skim through the Steam setup since you've already done most of it).
